## Alternative Financial Data Mining and Multi-modal Stock Prediction
### Introduction
The main objective is to develop a model for predicting future stock market price movements based on financial stock price and news headlines in a chronological order as inputs. The performance of the proposed model is assessed in terms of the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of stock prices of the twenty-five companies in the Hang Seng Index25.

### File structure
The files in the folder "Data Crawling" are to crawl stock price data & financial news data.  
The files in the folder "Models" are stock prediction LSTM model and proposed CNN-framework model.  
The files in the folder "Preprocessing" are to preprocess data before throwing them into models, including vector generation and dala alignment. 

### Reference
The proposed model is inspired from this [paper](https://www.aaai.org/ocs/index.php/IJCAI/IJCAI15/paper/view/11031/10986).
